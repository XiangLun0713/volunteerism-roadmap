        description: `After having a better understanding of the course structure and criteria, I've started to look for suitable voluntary activities that I can join. As I don't have transportation, I will be focusing on finding nearby voluntary activities.

        Here are some nearby organization that provides volunteer opportunities that I found on the Internet:

        1. <strong>PAWS (PAWS Animal Welfare Society)</strong> is a non-profit animal shelter in Petaling Jaya that has been in operation since 1987. They are actively looking for volunteers to help with the operation of the shelter. I plan to offer myself as a volunteer in the shelter to help cleaning out the shelter.
        
        2. <strong/>S.I (Seroja Inn) Home Shelter</strong> is a non-profit animal shelter founded by Muhamad Razeef bin Che Shamah in 2012. The shelter is also actively seeking for volunteers to ease the operation of the shelter. I plan to offer myself as a volunteer in the shelter to help cleaning out the shelter.

        3. <strong>Makerspace@UM</strong> is a collaborative space on the Universiti Malaya campus where students can gather to create, brainstorm, and work on DIY projects. As a computer science student, I plan to volunteer as a speaker/instructor to teach technology-related knowledge to the members and students.

        4. <strong>Rumah Hope</strong> is a sanctuary for abused, neglected, and underprivileged children between the ages of 5 and 17. It is located in Petaling Jaya, which is relatively close to the campus. I plan to offer myself as a voluntary tutor to teach the children in the shelter.

        5. <strong>Universiti Malaya Main Library</strong> was established in 1959 and has a total collection of more than a million up-to-date titles. The library is actively seeking volunteers to assist with daily operations. I plan to offer myself as a voluntary librariant and assist in various tasks in the Universiti Malaya Main Library.

        <strong>Conclusion</strong>:
        After searching and filtering the available activities, I've decided to conduct the following three voluntary activities throughout the course of 14 weeks:

        - Voluntary Librarian in the Main Library of Universiti Malaya
        - Volunteer Helper in the S.I. Home Shelter
        - Volunteer Speaker in Makerspace@UM

        The reason I chose to conduct two of my voluntary activities on campus is because I don't have any form of transportation other than public transport. Besides, I can't afford to use private booking transport systems such as Grab and AirAsia to travel to other places, as they are too expensive.

This session served as a great introduction, familiarizing the participants with the key concepts and components involved in creating mobile apps.
        
        Next, we delved into the realm of Flutter development. I guided the participants through the core concepts and features of Flutter. This segment allowed them to grasp the fundamental principles of Flutter and understand its advantages as a versatile framework for app development.
        
        Following that, we dived into Dart programming language, the language used for Flutter app development by going through the handbook that I've prepared beforehand. I introduced the participants to the syntax, data types, variables, and essential programming concepts in Dart. This session provided a solid foundation for them to start writing code using Dart.
        
        After an energizing lunch break, we resumed the workshop by exploring basic Flutter widgets. I demonstrated the usage and functionality of common widgets such as buttons, text fields, and containers. Participants had the opportunity to experiment with these widgets through hands-on exercises, fostering a deeper understanding of how to create interactive user interfaces.
        
        At the end of the workshop, I challenged the participants to build a user interface for a profile application. This activity allowed them to apply the concepts they had learned, including layout design, widget composition, and handling user interactions. It was truly inspiring to witness their creativity and problem-solving skills as they crafted their own unique profiles.

        description: `Today is the day of the the Eye of Pi workshop at Makerspace@UM. It should be conducted on 19 May 2023 but it was postponed by Makerspace@UM to 26 May 2023 due to insufficient time of advertisement. 

        I arrived at Makerspace@UM around 8.00 a.m and I started to help the speaker to set up the PCs so that the participants who does not bring their own laptop is able to use them. During the workshop, I assist on the participants that were lost or need help in general.
